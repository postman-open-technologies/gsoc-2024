## Postman's Org Application

API Specifications form an essential foundation to the API ecosystem, securing standardization, governance and overall quality of products building on this ecosystem, as well as APIs that are products themselves. Postman applies to Google Summer of Code 2024 to represent and advocate for the Specifications that are not in a position to bring in sufficient resources for an individual application. [Postman's Open Technologies](https://blog.postman.com/announcing-postman-open-technologies/) feel the strongest urge to raise our voice for the Open Source work that is being done in the API Specifications area, which is, similar to the API industry itself, still undervalued in its generally perceived impact on tech. [Read our blog](https://blog.postman.com/join-postman-at-google-summer-of-code-2023/) to learn more.

As explained before, this is an umbrella application for various API Specifications projects: [AsyncAPI](https://github.com/asyncapi) and [JSON Schema](https://github.com/json-schema-org). Consequently, it operates on two levels: Postman itself, which is responsible for gathering ideas and submitting the program application, and the API specification projects themselves responsible of choosing and mentoring students.

## A word on ChatGPT

When writing your proposal **we encourage you to not use ChatGPT** or other AI tools. If you do so, we ask you to disclose the usage in your proposal. It doesn't automatically disqualify you, but we will take that usage into account when evaluating your application.

If you have any questions or queries, please reach out to each Community depending on the project ideas you are interested in: [AsyncAPI Community](https://github.com/asyncapi) and/or [JSON Schema Community](https://github.com/json-schema-org).
